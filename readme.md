### Baking Terrain - A free terrain generation tool designed and programmed for other Unity Developers ### 

This project will be published to the Unity Asset Store for users to access as a tool. Created for Unity [2021.3.4f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

I have created a terrain generation tool to aid designers in generating customizable procedural terrain, including friendly user interface and explanation. The usefulness of this tools comes with it's ability to export the mesh as a .prefab for Designers to then drop into their own scenes. This would also be useful to the D&D and other RPG table-top groups, or any community of people who wish to create their own terrain without any coding experience.

Terrain modifications include and not limited to:
- Height – the generalised the height the mesh has.
- Detail – Ranging from a smoother cartoon look to more realistic terrain.
- Water level – the height the water sits at, aka sea level.
- Scale – the zoomed in value of the world (affects Perlin).
- Amplitude – strength of Perlin noise affecting mountains.
- Islands - control island shapes and intensity.

All work is my own however, multiple resources I have learnt from and gained inspiration from are listed below:

I used https://www.wolframalpha.com/ to visualize 3D graphs when creating some of my own island shape formulas and some formulas were used from: https://old.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/kaen7h/new_video_on_procedural_island_noise_generation/gfjmgen/
